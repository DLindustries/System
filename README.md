## üîß Improvements Over Original Argon Client

**ORIGINAL PROJECT**

https://github.com/LvStrnggg/argon/


This fork is approximately **75% based on the original Argon**, but with focused optimizations for **bypassing Vulcan** and reducing flagging on **Grim Anticheat**. It's a graphics and anticheat-optimized version of Argon with the following key changes:

- **Legit Autototem (HoverTotem-Like)**
    - Introduced **dynamic delay** to simulate human-like behavior
    - Prevents **impossible slot action B** with [DhandMod](https://github.com/DLindustries/D-hand-mod/).

- **Misclick Optimizer**
    - Rewritten and extended from Argon's original
    - Prevents **packet order B flags** (Grim)
    - Reduces **Multiactions F flagging**
    - Best paired with **AutoCrystal** and **Anchor Macro**

- **KeyPearl Enhancements**
    - Added **switchback slot selection** for faster **double-tapping** and **pearl flashing**
    - Eliminates **packet order B flagging** from original

- **Placement Optimizer**
    - Allows faster crystal placement pair with autocrystal, removing 2 tick placement delay - bypasses vulcan and grim
    - allows quick block up useful for cpvp
    - Now includes **anchor exclusion** to improve legit like gameplay with Anchor Macro

- **Target HUD Improvements**
    - Sleeker and cleaner design
    - Displays **extra opponent information** for PvP clarity

- **Camera Optimizer**
    - Improved camera control for better PvP experience such as no clip and water+ lava visual optimizers
    - Designed to work well with **Freelook mod**

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This is not a full rewrite ‚Äî it's still fundamentally Argon, but with meaningful tweaks to **bypass**, **optimize**, and **refine** both visuals and behavior for smoother gameplay under grim anticheat and vulcan.

## Configs

**Grim AC** - PvpHub, Donut SMP, and likely any other large Popular servers.

DON'T USE
- Autototem-blatant
- Autocrystal to lower than 2 ticks for both break and place
- Anchor Macro set to super fast - 0 ticks - test on loyisa.cn anticheat test server
- dtapsetup AT ALL
- break optimizer
- jump optimizer
- totem offhand

*YOU MUST*
- auto xp not 0 delay
- misclick optimizer MUST BE ENABLED WITH ALL SUBFUNCTIONS
- placement optimizer MUST EXCLUDE ANCHORS
- Use common sense, most 0 delays flag. Please check using a Anticheat server - eu.loyisa.cn

**Vulcan and other insignificant anticheats** - Eupvp.net, mcprac.net, mcpvp.club, Pvp Legacy, Stray.gg

Most modules bypasses. If you want safety, then:

*Use the same config for Grim AC BUT*

- you can use anchor macro safe and quickly using the DEFAULT settings.
- you can use Dig optimizer
- you can use jump optimizer
- you can use dtapsetup

**This is only a guide/general idea. For your own safety, i HIGHLY recommend you test your configs on a anticheat test server. BEFORE playing any of your favourite servers.**
