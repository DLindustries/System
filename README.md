## Mod description

</div>

Argon client fork that is still 75% argon that completely bypasses vulcan and flags much less on Grim AC

improved autototem legit - literally hovertotem by adding dynamic delay to simulate human behaviour and prevent impossible slot action B with dhandmod

added misclick optimizer - prevent in argon - with more functions and recode to prevent packet order B flags in grim and Multiactions F flagging in the original - pair with autocrystal and anchor macro

added option in keypearl with switchback slot selection for dtapping and pearl flashing efficiency and no more packet order b flags in original

added placement optimizer with anchor exclusion to look more legit with anchor macro

made their ass Target hud look better and sleek with additional opponent info

added Camera optimizer for better pvp experience - pair with freelook mod

i cant lie not too much has been added and edited from the original argon. System is merely a graphics and anticheat optimized fork of argon.
