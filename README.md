## 🔧 Improvements Over Original Argon Client

**ORIGINAL PROJECT**

https://github.com/LvStrnggg/argon/


This fork is approximately **75% based on the original Argon**, but with focused optimizations for **bypassing Vulcan** and reducing flagging on **Grim Anticheat**. It's a graphics and anticheat-optimized version of Argon with the following key changes:

- **Legit Autototem (HoverTotem-Like)**
  - Introduced **dynamic delay** to simulate human-like behavior
  - Prevents **impossible slot action B** with `dhandmod`

- **Misclick Optimizer**
  - Rewritten and extended from Argon's original
  - Prevents **packet order B flags** (Grim)
  - Reduces **Multiactions F flagging**
  - Best paired with **AutoCrystal** and **Anchor Macro**

- **KeyPearl Enhancements**
  - Added **switchback slot selection** for faster **double-tapping** and **pearl flashing**
  - Eliminates **packet order B flagging** from original

- **Placement Optimizer**
  - Allows faster crystal placement pair with autocrystal, removing 2 tick placement delay - bypasses vulcan and grim
  - allows quick block up useful for cpvp
  - Now includes **anchor exclusion** to improve legit like gameplay with Anchor Macro

- **Target HUD Improvements**
  - Sleeker and cleaner design
  - Displays **extra opponent information** for PvP clarity

- **Camera Optimizer**
  - Improved camera control for better PvP experience such as no clip and water+ lava visual optimizers
  - Designed to work well with **Freelook mod**

> ⚠️ Note: This is not a full rewrite — it's still fundamentally Argon, but with meaningful tweaks to **bypass**, **optimize**, and **refine** both visuals and behavior for smoother gameplay under grim anticheat and vulcan.
